                 <p>She has a passion for web design and development as well as a passion for astrology.</p>
                   <p>The first model of Zee's astrologies was a make-shift C++ website that she made as a project in her Intro to programming class
                    and now she decided to bring that same concept to life using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.</p>
                 <p> Overall, Zee's Astrologies is a way for her to merge her two passions into something fruitful and she hopes to continue
