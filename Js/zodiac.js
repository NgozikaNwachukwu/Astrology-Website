        incompatibility: "Scorpio often encounters compatibility challenges with signs that value independence, superficiality, or a more carefree approach to life, which can clash with Scorpio's intense and passionate nature. One of the most difficult matches is with Aquarius, an air sign known for its unconventional and freedom-loving spirit.
